## *test_script_filename.py*

This script opens all the images in the *test_folder/* folder, rescale the intensity, select the 25 first frames of the folder, write the name of the file on the images and make a 5x5 frames montage saved as *test_filename.tif*

## *test_script_time.py*

This script opens all the images in the *test_folder/* folder, rescale the intensity, select the 25 first frames of the folder, write the name of the file on the images and add also the time stamp and make a 5x5 frames montage saved as *test_time.tif*

## *test_script_stack.py*

This script opens a *test_stack.tif*, rescale the intensity, select the 25 first frames of the folder, write the name of the file on the images and make a 5x5 frames montage saved as *test_stack_filename.tif*
